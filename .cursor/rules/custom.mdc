1. General Project Rules

Use Vue 3 + TypeScript
State management — Pinia
Style preprocessor — SCSS or TailwindCSS
Maximum UI component size — 100 lines
Maximum file length — 200 lines
Maximum function length — 10 lines
Follow SOLID and DRY principles
Use a design system and reference base components and color palette

2. Project Structure

src/components/ — reusable components
src/pages/ — pages (e.g., Home.vue, Dashboard.vue)
src/store/ — state management using Pinia
src/composables/ — reusable logic (hooks, API requests)
src/assets/ — images, fonts, styles
src/config/ — configuration and global variables
src/types/ — TypeScript types and interfaces
src/utils/ — utility functions and helpers
src/directives/ — custom Vue directives

3. Code Style

Indentation: 2 spaces
Use single quotes (') instead of double quotes
No semicolon (;)
Maximum line length: 100 characters
Trailing commas in objects (trailingComma: 'all')
Use PascalCase for component names
Use camelCase for variables and methods
Avoid any, use explicit types and interfaces
Use defineProps and defineEmits with TypeScript types
Destructure props instead of using this.props

4. Vue Components

Use <script setup> for cleaner code
Maximum 5 props per component
Maximum 10 methods per component
Always use scoped styles
Use computed properties instead of methods when possible
Avoid unnecessary reactivity (ref or reactive only when needed)
Use v-bind for dynamic attributes instead of inline expressions
Avoid using v-if and v-for together for performance reasons
Keep template logic minimal, move complex logic to computed or methods

5. Performance & Optimization

Lazy load routes using defineAsyncComponent
Use dynamic imports for large dependencies
Use the key attribute with v-for
Use watch instead of watchEffect unless reactivity tracking is required
Avoid deep watchers unless necessary
Debounce expensive operations like API calls inside watch or computed

6. Security & Best Practices

Never use v-html unless absolutely necessary
Sanitize user input before processing
Use environment variables for sensitive data
Always validate props with proper TypeScript types
Use async/await instead of .then() for better readability
Handle errors using try/catch and provide fallback UI
Keep dependencies updated and remove unused packages

7. Task Completion and Server Start

After completing a task, there is no need to require starting the server unless explicitly specified
Focus on ensuring that the code passes linting and tests before finalizing the task
